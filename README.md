# Unite SDK Examples

Here we provide some API examples based on articles written for our [documentation](https://www.socialengine.com/support/article/74711060/unite-development-getting-started).

## Configuration

Depending on your language of choice, make sure to rename the config file in `/examples/_config/[LANGUAGE]/config.*.example` by removing the `.example`.

Then fill out the required constants/variables:

| Constant/Variable | Description                                                                                    |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SE_URL            | URL to your Unite site.                                                                        |
| SE_TOKEN          | Your API token.                                                                                |
